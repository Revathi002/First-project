        <p>Clothing Concepts has stayed true to its name since its inception in 1899. We are a multi-dimensional
            clothing company with high impact brands built over the past decade with new plans and ventures for the
            immediate future. Our dream from the companyâ€™s initiation has been to develop new concepts in existing areas
            of standard/structured clothing and also envision new advanced concepts.</p>

        <p>At ACC, we keep dreaming and more importantly, doing. Each division of ACC has a story and path to take pride
            in. ACC has been and always will be people-centred. Our companyâ€™s presence has grown from a single-city
            business to being an eminent player in Institutional Clothing in South India. We aim to become a national
            standard for institutional clothing. Our strength lies in our home grown brands, but our plan for the future
            is to expand into acquiring other brands. We see a sustainable path of long-term growth as we continue to
            execute our core business strategies. ACC aims to pioneer new concepts into the retail market with our
            strength in impeccable sourcing, disciplined and structured operational capabilities and the ever-growing
            strength of our professionals. We have also moved above and beyond institutional clothing and initiated our
            path into retail by developing brands with optimistic market opportunities such as performance wear, infant
            wear and art fabrics.</p>

        <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking
            at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,
            as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop
            publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for
            'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the
            years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like)</p>
